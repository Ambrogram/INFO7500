## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our AMM implementation seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

We are committed to working with security researchers to resolve any issues that are reported to us. We will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment of the report within 1 week
- Keep you informed of our progress toward a fix
- Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer otherwise)

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release a new version with the fix
5. Disclose the vulnerability publicly

## Security Best Practices

When using this AMM implementation:

1. **Never share private keys or seed phrases**
2. **Use test networks for development and testing**
3. **Verify contract addresses before interacting**
4. **Review all transactions before confirming**
5. **Keep software and dependencies updated**
6. **Use hardware wallets for large amounts**
